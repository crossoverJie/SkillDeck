# Twitter/X Post Preferences

## Structure
1. First introduce what SkillDeck is (for first-time readers)
2. Then briefly mention the update (keep it short, e.g. "vX.X.X just dropped")
3. Include brew install command
4. Include GitHub link
5. End with hashtags: #buildinpublic #devtools

## Style Rules
- No AI-sounding language, keep it natural
- Minimize line breaks — X counts newlines as characters, compress into continuous paragraphs
- Be concise, respect X's character limit (280 chars per post, or ~4000 for X Premium)
- Don't over-explain the update — a brief mention is enough, let the release page speak for itself
- Skip documentation-only changes (e.g. README translations, typo fixes) — only mention feature/code updates

## Brew Install Format
- Use one-liner: `brew tap crossoverJie/skilldeck && brew install --cask skilldeck`

## Hashtags
- #buildinpublic #devtools

## Reference Post (v0.0.7)
I built SkillDeck — a native macOS app for managing AI code agent skills across Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Copilot CLI. Browse, install, edit, and toggle skills for all your agents in one place. No more hand-editing YAML or wiring up symlinks manually. v0.0.7 just dropped.
